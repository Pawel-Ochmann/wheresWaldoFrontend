## A Photo Tagging App Project

This is the frontend repository for the Full Stack Photo Tagging App Project built for the [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app).

The goal of the project was to build an online 'Where's Wally' game, where user has to find a Wally on a big image, and application is checking on a server whether the location is correct or not. It also allows to store top scores for each image.

Frontend part is using react/typescript, backend - Express.js/MongoDB. Both are written in typescript.
